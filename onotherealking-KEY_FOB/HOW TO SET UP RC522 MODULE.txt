HOW TO SETUP RFID-RC522 2ITH ARDUINO UNO
WIRING
The following LIST shows the needed connections between the RFID and the Arduino Uno
RFID-RC522
Module
          Arduino Uno
1 -       SDA Digital 10
2 -       SCK Digital 13
3 -       MOSI Digital 11
4 -       MISO Digital 12
5 -       IRQ --unconnected--
6 -    	  GND Gnd
7 -       RST Digital
Cautions:
*On the Arduino many of the pins are not swappable. Because this device uses the SPI bus, who’s pins cannot be moved
around, pins 11, 12, 13 must remain as shown. RST and IRQ are user specified.
*This device is NOT a 5 volt powered device. You MUST power it with 3.3 volts. If you do not, you risk overheating the
RFID. Most Arduino boards include a 3.3V supply pin which can be used to power the RFID module. 
*The connection wires must be soldered to the module if not the arduino shows an error ststing there is no connection

ADDING THE LIBRARY
If you haven’t already done so, the AddicoreRFID library needs to be added to your Arduino library depository.
1. Download the Addicore RFID library from Github.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to Sketch > Include Library. A drop down menu will
appear. Click the option to “Add .ZIP Library…”
3. A window will open. Navigate to the location where the AddicoreRFID library you downloaded above is currently located
and open it.
4. You can confirm that the library has been installed by again navigating to Sketch > Include Library. The AddicoreRFID
library should now show in the list of “Contributed libraries.

PROGRAMMING THE ARDUINO
After installing the AddicoreRFID library in the steps above the library will be available to use in sketches but any example
sketches included with the library may not be shown in File > Examples until after restarting the Arduino IDE.
1. Restart the Arduino IDE by closing all currently open Arduino IDE windows and then opening the Arduino IDE.
2. When the Arduino IDE opens navigate to File > Examples > AddicoreRFID. Select the “Addicore_RFID_Example” sketch.
This will open a sketch which we will use with the RFID module that we wired to our Arduino earlier.
3. Now connect your Arduino to your computer and upload the code.
