HOW TO CONNECT DRAGINO LORAWAN SHIELD TO TTN USING ABP
Install LMIC Library in Arduino IDE i.e open IDE--> sketch--> Include Library-->Manage Library.
In line 659 in radio.c in one of the source files of the LMIC Library, add "static" at the start.
To get source file of LMIC Library Navigate to C:\Users\yourUserName\Documents\Arduino\libraries\arduino-lmic-master\src\lmic.
Then open the website https://github.com/SensorsIot/LoRa/blob/master/Nodes/Dragino/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.ino copy and paste to Arduino IDE.
Then change the pin mapping to: 
const lmic_pinmap lmic_pins = {
    .nss = 10,
    .rxtx = LMIC_UNUSED_PIN,
    .rst = 9,
    .dio = {2, 6, 7},
}
in the first few lines of code the network key, device address and application key need to be added to the code.
To get this information you need to go to the thing network website and create an application in your console.
Ensure the activation method is ABP.
Under the application go to register device to generate this information.
Copy the information in the correct format to your example code.
Then run.
