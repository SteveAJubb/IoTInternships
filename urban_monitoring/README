ESP32 TTN OTAA with LMIC

Pre-requisities:

Add ESP32 to Arduino IDE: 
https://www.instructables.com/id/Installing-ESP32-on-Arduino-IDE-the-Easy-Method/

Download LMIC library: 
https://github.com/matthijskooijman/arduino-lmic

May have to find an up-to-date hal.h header file from: 
https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-lmic/tree/master/src/hal

Setup a TTN console and add a device. The device under the console is where APPSKEY etc will be found:

These sketches will:
Allow the user to send data periodically or on a trigger event, depending on which sketch the user is working on. 
Warrning: the sketches are set for the 868MHz band. Change this to the appropriate frequency in your band with the arduino_lmic_hal_configuration.h header file
These sketches allow for easy connection to TTN and are set up for use with a HC-SR04 sensor. All variables relating to this sensor are marked with comments.
The message sent is the  variable called mydata. mydata is an array of unsigned integers. Do not attempt to pass long strings into this.
Understand that editing an element of the mydata array simply changes an integer value, which the user can use to sended coded messages to be decoded at the console.
